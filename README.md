# UC_HT_T1DM
This dataset contains information about 15 subjects where there are healthy people (subjects 1-10) and T1DM people (Subjects 11-15).

The variables which are showed in this dataset are:

a) Glucose (mg/dl): It corresponds to interstitial glucose which was done by Guardian sensor 3 with a sampling time of 5 min.

b) Heart Rate (bpm): This measure was done by Fitbit Charge 4 with a sampling time of 5 sec.

c) Step (-): It corresponds to the measurement of steps taken which was done by Fitbit Charge 4 with a sampling time of 1 min.

d) Carbohydrates (g): It corresponds to the intake of carbohydrates by the person. This value was obtained from the patient's self-report of food intake.

e) IGAR (g/min): It corresponds to the estimation of rate of glucose absorption in the intestine which was done using the Hovorka model (Hovorka et al., 2004).

f) Insulin: It corresponds to the basal rate (U/h) and bolus (U) of exogenous insulin used in T1DM patients.

This dataset was created in the investigation associated to
