# Dataset explanation
This dataset contains data from 25 subjects, 15 healthy people (HT 1-15) and 10 subjects with T1DM (T1DM 1-10).

The variables included are:

a) Glucose (mg/dl): interstitial glucose obtained with the Guardian sensor 3 with a sampling time of 5 min.

b) Heart Rate (bpm): measured by Fitbit Charge 4 with a sampling time of 5 sec.

c) Step (-): corresponds to steps taken by the subject estimated by Fitbit Charge 4 with a sampling time of 1 min.

d) Carbohydrates (g): corresponds to the intake of carbohydrates. This value was obtained from the patient's self-report of food intake.

e) IGAR (g/min): corresponds to the estimation of rate of glucose absorption in the intestine obtained using the Hovorka model (Hovorka et al., 2004).

f) Insulin: corresponds to the basal rate (U/h) and bolus (U) of exogenous insulin used by T1DM patients.
